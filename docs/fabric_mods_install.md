# Minecraft Mod Install Guide

We recommend installing mods using Fabric to run Discovery.

## Installing Fabric

1. Download the installer from [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/) and install Fabric
2. Run the downloaded executable file
3. Select "Client" → Choose "1.19" for the Minecraft version (should support up to 1.20.6, but this is unconfirmed)
4. Press "Install" to install Fabric.

## Installing Mods

1. Press "Win" + "R" to open "Run", enter "%appdata%" and press "OK".
2. In the application folder, open ".minecraft" → "mods".
3. Download the following mods and save them in the mods folder.

   **Note: After opening the curseforge link, change "Files" "All Games Version" to your desired version (e.g., 1.19) and download the compatible jar file**
   - [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api)
   - [CompleteConfig](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/completeconfig)
   - [Mod Menu](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modmenu)
   - [Multiplayer Server Pause (Forge)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/multiplayer-server-pause-forge)

## Verification

1. Launch the Minecraft launcher.
2. If Fabric has been installed successfully, "Fabric-loader-your_version" will be displayed in the Minecraft Java Edition build selection.
3. Select the Fabric build and press "Play". A warning will appear, but press "Play".
4. If the mod installation is complete, it will start without problems. If errors occur, check the versions of the installed mods.
